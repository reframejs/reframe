Instead of being one big monolith,
Reframe is merely a collection of tools and starters.

Reframe gives you the same guidance and high development speed as a big monolith without being one.

**[WIP]** This project is work-in-progress.
That said, Goldpage and Wildcard are production-ready tools that you can use today.

&nbsp;

:hammer_and_wrench: **Tools**

<img
  align="right"
  src="/images/reframe-tech.svg"
  width="200"
  height="300"
/>

Do-one-thing-do-it-well tools are the backbone of Reframe.
We use React, Node.js, and develop our own:

- [Goldpage](https://github.com/reframejs/goldpage) -
  Page Builder &mdash;
  create a modern frontend.
- [Wildcard API](https://github.com/reframejs/wildcard-api) -
  JavaScript Functions as API &mdash;
  create an API between your Node.js backend and your browser frontend.
- [ProtoDB](https://github.com/brillout/proto-db) -
  A simple filesystem-based database for prototypes and small to medium-sized apps.
- **Auto-Deploy** -
  Simple and fully automatic single-machine deployment.
  [Work-in-progress]

Each of our tools can be used individually and independently of each other.

For a quick start,
you can use a starter which pre-assembles a stack for you.
You can also assemble a stack yourself.
For example,
if your company is more experienced with Vue than React,
you can use Vue instead of React.
If you need mutli-machine deployments, you can use Docker instead of our single-machine deployment tool.
If you need to provide an API to third-party developers,
you can use GraphQL instead of RPC.
Etc.

With Reframe,
you own your stack,
you keep your freedom.

&nbsp;

:rocket: **Starters**

Our starters assemble tools into well-polished scaffolds.
We design our starters to be simple and to include only what you need.

- [Reframe Proto](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-proto) -
  Frontend (React, Goldpage) + Backend (Node.js, Hapi) + API (Wildcard).
  <br/>
  Reframe Proto assembles tools for rapid-prototyping.
  Start building your app today,
  deliver your first MVP tomorrow,
  and progressively replace rapid-prototyping tools with entreprise-grade tools as you scale.
- [Reframe Frontend](https://github.com/reframejs/reframe-frontend) -
  Frontend (React, Goldpage).
  <br/>
  If you don't need a backend or you already have one,
  you can use our frontend-only stack.

Our starters enable you to develop
with the same guidance and high development speed as classical frameworks
while keeping your freedom.

&nbsp;

:crystal_ball: **Future-Proof**

Instead of being a big monolith,
Reframe is merely a collection of
- Do-one-thing-do-it-well tools.
- Starters.

This fundamentally different approach enables
- Reframe to adopt the technologies of tomorrow.
- You to replace technologies as you scale.

In short, Reframe is future-proof.
We call our approach the [Zero-LOC framework](/zero-loc-framework.md).
